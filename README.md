# Algorithms in Go

I created a repo a couple of years ago for [Algorithms in JavaScript](https://github.com/subfuzion/algorithms-in-javascript)
because I felt there weren't enough testable examples for JavaScript/Node.js suitable for beginners. It was a modest effort with
only thirty or so examples and I never quite found the time to do more with the repo.

So this repo is the beginning of a new attempt to raise the bar a bit with documentation and tests to share with
others, and this time I've chosen Go for the programming language. I chose Go because languages like C/C++, Java, etc., are
already so well represented in books and online. Go has been around since 2009, but has seen a signficant rise in popularity
over the past few years. I use Go full time for my day job, side projects, and open source development around Docker. Go is a
serious systems programming language that has a standardized format and simple testing facility that makes this an
excellent choice for demonstrating algorithm programming concepts.
